We believe that every individual is a star, waiting to shine in their own constellation.

- 🧭 **Why “Nebula”?**  
  - In the cosmos, a **nebula** is where new stars are born—a dense cradle of interstellar matter where possibility ignites into light.  
  - In NEBULA, young dreamers gather to experience and explore a universe of careers, broadening their horizons and creating their own stars.  
  - As they grow and realize their dreams, they become shining stars—sharing real-world stories, lessons, and inspiration with the next generation.
